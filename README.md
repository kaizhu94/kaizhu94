### Hi, my name is Kaihua Zhu and I am full-stack software engineer. I am a Bachelor in Computer Science of West Virginia University and a recent graduate from App Academy. I'm passionate about problem-solving, debugging, and writing clean, semantic code. I am always looking for more opportunities to delve into new languages, frameworks, or mathematical concepts.👋

### I’m currently seeking a full stack software engineering role where I can utilize my coding skills in impactful and meaningful ways as well as grow as a developer.
