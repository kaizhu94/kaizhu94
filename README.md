### Hi, my name is Kaihua Zhu and I am full-stack software engineer. I am a Bachelor in Computer Science of West Virginia University and a recent graduate from App Addcamy. I'm passionate about problem-solving, debugging, and writing clean, semantic code. I am always looking for more opportunities to delve into new languages, frameworks, or mathematical concepts.ðŸ‘‹
